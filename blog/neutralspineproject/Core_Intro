You've heard the term here and there. May be you've stumbled on a article or two here and there but the anatomy and the technicality of it was too much for you to persist and understand. 


So you thought you've core figured out. Think again. 

// introduction of deep core stuff
 As talked about in sufficient details by <insert different link of TVA articles here> various people in the physiotherapy and posture community <stop link>,  core isn't *just* what most people think about. Apart from the superficial muscles of rectus abdominis, obliques and spinal erectors, there is also a deeper layer of muscle groups which are the "key muscle groups". These involve the TVA (transverse abdominis), diaphgram, pelvic floor and multifidus. 


And the most important part? You're probably doing, for the lack of a better suited word, a half-assed job at saving your spine and posture by only involving the superficial muscles. To make matters worse every time you're adding weight to that position, you are making it harder to recruit these inner key muscles. 



// Reference to the debate
Some of you might recognize this old debate. The likes of lower back experts e.g. Stuart Mcgill and other "lifting friendly" physios and atheletic therapists have indeed stated that healthy atheletes shouldn't bothered with trying to bring in or isolate TVA into the picture as it messes with the movement. Instead they should just think of the "core as a unit". <Must insert references here> 

On the other hand, especially the "non-lifting" and more academic physiotherapist community swear by importance of these
